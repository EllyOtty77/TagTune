##  Usage Instructions

###  1. Tag a Song Interactively

```bash
python tagger.py
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter title, artist, album, year, genre, comment, and cover art path.

###  2. Tag with Command-Line Arguments

```bash
python tagger.py --file "track.mp3" --title "Unreleased Banger" --artist "Elly" --album "Secret Stash" --year 2025 --genre "Soul" --cover "cover.jpg"
```

---

### 3. Read Metadata from a Song

```bash
python tagger.py --read --file "mystery.mp3"
```

Displays tags like title, artist, album, genre, comment, and whether it has cover art.

---

### 4. Export All MP3 Metadata to CSV

```bash
python tagger.py --dumpcsv "C:/Users/user/Music"
```

This scans a folder recursively and writes metadata of every `.mp3` file to a CSV called `music_metadata.csv`.
